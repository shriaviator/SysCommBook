  - `2,3p` range - 2nd to 3rd line
  - `/hello/` matches and shows first occurance of the pattern
  - `+` and `-` to scroll by line
  - `;p` from current position to end of buffer
  - `.` displays the current line
  - `!date` running the date command within `ed`
  - `r !date` read output of date command to buffer at current position
  - `w` writes the file (saves it)
  - `d` delete current line
  - `a` to append after current line. Press `.` and `enter` when done
  - `s/appended/Appended/` Substitute - Search and replace from current line.
  - `f` shows the name of the file being edited
  - `p` shows the contents of the current line 
  - `j` for joining lines . Usage `5,6j` to join line 5 and 6
  - `m` to move a line to a particular position. Usage `m1` to move current line to just below line 1. `m0` to move it right to the top
  - `u` to undo previous change
  - To add something to every line `%s/\(.*\)/PREFIX \1/`
    - `\1` is the back substitution
